- TypeScript (for type safety and better developer experience)
- Tailwind CSS (for responsive and modern UI design)
- Additional Libraries:
  - React Router (for navigation)
  - React Query (for data fetching and caching)
  - React Hook Form (for form handling)
  - Axios (for API requests)

### Backend

- Express.js (Node.js framework)
- TypeScript
- Additional Libraries:
  - Express Validator (for input validation)
  - JWT (for authentication)
  - Cors (for handling CORS)

## Development Guidelines

- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Implement proper error handling
- Write unit tests for critical functionality
- Use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting
- Follow Git flow branching strategy
- Document API endpoints using OpenAPI/Swagger

## Security Considerations

- Implement rate limiting
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Enable CORS with proper configuration
- Implement input sanitization
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Regular security audits

## Performance Requirements

- Page load time < 2 seconds
- API response time < 500ms
- Support for 100+ concurrent users
- Desktop-first responsive design
